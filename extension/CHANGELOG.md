# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased][]

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed-auth/compare/v0.3.0...HEAD

### Breaking Changes

- Extract `AuthBackend` into `trussed-auth-backend` crate
- Use `trussed-core` and remove default features for `trussed`

## [0.3.0][] - 2024-03-22

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed-auth/releases/tag/v0.3.0

### Breaking Changes

- Add `delete_app_keys` and `delete_auth_keys` syscalls. ([#33][])

  - `delete_all_pins` now doesn't affect application keys
  - `reset_app_keys`: delete all application keys. Getting them again after calling this will not yield the same key
  - `reset_auth_data` combines `delete_all_pins` and `delete_app_keys`

  Applications (trussed-secrets) relying on the old `delete_all_pins` behaviour will need to be fixed.
- Update Trussed dependency ([#33][], [#35][], [#37][])
